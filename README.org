* Prerequisites

** Special fonts
The special fonts is to support the pertty display of powerline theme like:

[[https://www.dropbox.com/s/bty5zanck06jacj/zsh-powerline.png?raw=1][https://www.dropbox.com/s/bty5zanck06jacj/zsh-powerline.png?raw=1]]

Install the powerline fonts following instructions below:

1. First, Download and install fonts from [[https://github.com/powerline/fonts/][here]]
2. Then, configure your [[https://www.iterm2.com/][iTerm2]] fonts settings

- iTerm > Preferences > Profile > Text :: change both =Regular Font= and =Non-ASCII Font=.

** Meta settings
Many great shell key bindings are inheritant from Emacs and hence the Meta key is of good use.
To enbale this, configure your iTerm2 at:

- iTerm > Preferences > Profile > Keys :: both options to =+Esc=. Now option keys act like Meta keys.

* Installation

In the =.zsh= directory, call the =./INSTALL.sh= to install it.

This is based on [[https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh][Oh-my-zsh]], if you didn't installed it or =~/.oh-my-zsh/= is not found,
the install script will install it automatically.

*NOTE*: If you haven't install =oh-my-zsh=, the =oh-my-zsh= installer will run a new
zsh shell after the installation finished. Please press =Ctrl-D= to quit this shell to
make the =INSTALL.sh= continue.

*NOTE*: If you didn't install the special fonts metioned above, my default powerline theme will
not display properly.

* Custom settings
By default, you can create a file named =~/.zsh.my.sh= and put your settings there. Typically
there are few variable you may be interested to change it:

- DEFAULT_USER :: tell zsh your default user's name so that you can log in without prompting current username
- INSTALLER :: the default is "brew install" for Mac users. If you're a Linux user you must change this to
               your own package install command to make sure the auto-install facility works.
- my_zsh_mod :: specify plugins you want to load. You can view all available plugins in =plugins= folder.
- MY_JAVA_CP :: used in java plugin. indicates where you preferred to store downloaded jar files.
            default value is "~/include/java/"


The examples are:

#+header: :tangle yes
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  #!/bin/zsh
  # file: ~/.zsh.my.sh
  export DEFAULT_USER=jack
  export INSTALLER='apt-get install' # Mac user don't have to set this
  my_zsh_mod=(python java) # don't use export on lists
  export MY_JAVA_CP='~/include/java/'
#+END_SRC

* Added Functions

I've collects several good functions from the web. Amount them I think there are 2 functions
totally changed my life in the shell.

The first one is [[http://ranger.nongnu.org/][ranger]] -- a file system manager in command line. Its key bindings are
simulating the vim. Its common used keys are listed at the =ranger= section.

The second one is a shell history searching utility which make benifits from an /interactive querying lib/
-- [[https://github.com/mooz/percol][percol]]. With this you type some partial contents, separates keywords with whitespaces. And then the
=percol= will filter the results for you.

| name   | function               | rank   |
|--------+------------------------+--------|
| Ctrl+R | search shell history   | Killer |
| Ctrl-S | file manager           | Killer |
| ff     | file partial searching | Helper |
| pclip  | stdin into clipboard   | Helper |

* For newbies

** Common Emacs shortcuts in shell

Most of the shell supports Emacs key bindings by default.

Let 'C' stands for Ctrl, 'M' stands for 'Meta'.

| key           | function                  | mutation    | function |
|---------------+---------------------------+-------------+----------|
| C-A           | beginning of line         |             |          |
| C-E           | *E*-nd of line            |             |          |
| C-K           | *K*-ill to end of line    |             |          |
| C-U           | *U*-ntype words           |             |          |
| C-D           | *D*-elete forward         | M-D         | one word |
| BACKSPACE/C-H | delete backward           | M-BACKSPACE | one word |
| C-F           | move *F*-orward one char  | M-F         | one word |
| C-B           | move *B*-ackward one char | M-B         | one word |
| C-P           | *P*-revious command       |             |          |
| C-N           | *N*-ext command           |             |          |
| C-L           | clear screen              |             |          |

Being familiar with the Meta shortcuts will makes your shell using more effective.

** Common vim shorcuts in shell

in =man=, =less=, these vim style key bindings are also usable.
